#### ABY Crop Protection Reports

Draft chapters for a final report required by the Department of Energy's Algal Biomass Yield (ABY) funding opportunity (grant EE0006315). When the project ended in 2016, the final report was not submitted. These reports summarize various observations and approaches to crop protection that were developed by Sapphire Energy for various algal strains, although the primary focus of the project became _Nannochloropsis_. The reports were authored by the Crop Protection Team which includes Philip Lee, Christopher Meenach, Kalli Lambeth, Mike Burnett, and Sal Lopez.

#### Crop Protection Research

The result of a white paper study conducted in 2015 to identify potential treatments or methods to protect the algae crops in ponds. It was written from the perspective of _Nannochloropsis_, but contains information that would be applicable to any strain. The values in the column "Worth Pursuing" are qualitative opinions from Sapphire staff about whether the protection ought to be tested.
