#### ABY Crop Protection Reports

These are draft chapters for a final report required by the Department of Energy's Algal Biomass Yield (ABY) funding opportunity (grant EE0006315). When the project ended in 2016, the final report was not submitted. These reports summarize various observations and approaches to crop protection that were developed by Sapphire Energy for various algal strains, although the primary focus of the project became *Nannochloropsis*. The reports were authored by the Crop Protection Team which includes Philip Lee, Christopher Meenach, Kalli Lambeth, Mike Burnett, and Sal Lopez.
