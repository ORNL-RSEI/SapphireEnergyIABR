SE50279,Chlamydomonas  ,reihardtii,TAP,CC-125,wild type mt+ [137c] from Boynton-Gillham laboratory Duke University. This is the basic “137c” wild type strain originally islated by GM Smith (1945) near Amherst MA and is presumably equivalent to strain 11/32c of the Culture Centre of Algae and Protozoa. This particular strain was brought to Duke by NW Gillham in 1968 from RP Levine’s laboratory at Harvard. It carries the nit1 and nit2 mutations and cannot grow on nitrate as their sole N source. It carries the AGG1 (agg1+) allele for phototactic aggregation. It is the background strain for many mutations including CC-503 cw92 mt+ which was the source of DNA used for genomic sequencing.,Freshwater unicellular green alga about 10 µm in diameter that swims with two flagella.

SE50280,Chlamydomonas ,reihardtii,TAP,CC-400,cw15 mt+ from K-S Chiang at University of Chicago. Originally from SJ Surzycki and brought to Duke by David Grant (1978). This is the most widely used wall-deficient mutant and this mutation is present in many strains in the Chlamydomonas Resource Center collection. Davies characterized it as a mutant in his class C defined as mutants in which cell walls are absent or produced in greatly reduced quantity compared to wild type. Wall-deficient mutants form flat liquid colonies on agar and the cells lyse in a 1% solution of the nonionic detergent NP-40. The original stock required 0.2% sodium acetate for growth in liquid and was quite sensitive to pH and/or CO2. This single clone isolate does not require acetate and is not sensitive.,Freshwater unicellular green alga about 10 µm in diameter that swims with two flagella.
